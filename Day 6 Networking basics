#  Ethernet Network Connectivity - Summary

Today, I explored different types of connectivity used in **Ethernet networks** and how to choose the right network media.

##  Common Ethernet Media Types

### 1. Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
- A set of color-coded wires arranged in pairs.
- Commonly used for Ethernet connections.
- Cost-effective and easy to install.

### 2. Coaxial Cable
- Uses **BNC** or **F-type screw connectors**.
- Ideal for high-frequency transmission.
- Common in satellite communication systems.

### 3. Fiber Optic Cable
- Made of **glass or plastic**.
- Used for high-speed data transmission within buildings.
- Transmits data as pulses of light.

##  Media Types by Transmission Method

| Media Type                   | Description                                 | Example               |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Metal wires (copper)        | Data is encoded as electrical impulses      | UTP cables             |
| Glass/plastic fibers        | Data is encoded as light pulses             | Fiber optic cables     |
| Wireless transmission       | Data encoded via frequency modulation       | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth       |

##  Criteria for Choosing Network Media

1. **Maximum transmission distance** – How far can the signal travel?
2. **Installation environment** – Indoors, outdoors, or industrial?
3. **Speed and bandwidth needs** – How much data and how fast?
4. **Cost** – Budget for media and installation
