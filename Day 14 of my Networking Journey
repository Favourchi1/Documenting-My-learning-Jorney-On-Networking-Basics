## Module 14: Routing Between Networks

###  What I Learned

Routing is the process of determining the best path for data to travel across networks. It ensures that packets find the most efficient route from the source to the destination.

A **router** is a Layer 3 networking device responsible for forwarding data between different IP networks. It's essential in enabling communication beyond local subnets.

###  Key Concepts

- **Routing Table**: A database in the router that holds information about network paths.
- **Static Routing**: Routes are manually configured by a network administrator.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Routes are automatically updated based on information shared between routers using routing protocols (like RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP).

###  Insight

Routing is like giving data a GPSâ€”it ensures that every packet takes the most efficient and logical path to reach its destination. Whether dynamic or static, routing decisions greatly impact network efficiency and security.
