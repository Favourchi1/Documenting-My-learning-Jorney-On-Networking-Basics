#  Day 7 of My Networking Basics Journey

Today, I explored how **Ethernet** works in local networks and learned about how data is transmitted and received between devices.

##  Ethernet and Local Area Networks (LANs)

- Ethernet is commonly used in **Local Area Networks (LANs)** such as homes, offices, and schools.
- Each device that connects to an Ethernet network uses a **Network Interface Card (NIC)**.
- Every NIC has a **unique MAC address** that is permanently embedded, helping to identify the device on the network.

##  Ethernet Frame Structure

I took a deep dive into the components of an **Ethernet frame** — the structured format that data takes when sent across a network:

1. **Preamble** – Synchronizes communication between devices.
2. **Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)** – Marks the start of the frame.
3. **Destination MAC Address** – Identifies the recipient device.
4. **Source MAC Address** – Identifies the sender device.
5. **Length/Type Field** – Indicates the type of data or protocol.
6. **Encapsulated Data** – The actual data being transmitted.
7. **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)** – Helps detect errors during transmission.

##  Encapsulation vs. Decapsulation

- **Encapsulation** is the process of **placing data inside a specific message format** so it can be transmitted over the network — like placing a letter into an envelope.
- **Decapsulation** is the reverse — the **receiver removes the envelope to read the message** inside.

This helped me better understand how devices prepare and interpret data as it moves through a network.

##  Reflection

This session brought more clarity into how data travels and how Ethernet organizes that journey. Understanding the concept of encapsulation and how data is structured at the frame level was a major takeaway for me.

I'm excited to continue building my knowledge in **networking and cybersecurity** one step at a time!
