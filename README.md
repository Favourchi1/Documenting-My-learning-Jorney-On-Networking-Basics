# Documenting-My-learning-Jorney-On-Networking-Basics
#  Day 1 of My Networking Basics Journey

Today marks the beginning of my journey into the world of **computer networking**, and I’m excited to document each step as I learn and grow!

##  Introduction to the Internet

I started with the fundamentals—**What is the Internet?**  
A key takeaway: **no single person or group owns the Internet**. It is a **global system** of interconnected networks, managed by various organizations, ISPs, governments, and individuals.

> The internet works because many different networks voluntarily agree to interconnect and communicate using standardized protocols.

##  Understanding Network Types

Next, I explored the different **network types** that enable internet access:

- **Local Area Networks (LANs)** – small networks within homes or offices  
- **Mobile Devices** – smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches that connect over cellular networks or Wi-Fi  
- **Connected Home Devices** – smart TVs, thermostats, game consoles, smart appliances, and more  

These devices interact seamlessly through routers and switches, forming the backbone of everyday digital communication.

##  Diving into Data Transmission

Then I moved into how **data** is transmitted and categorized:

- **Volunteer Data** – data users actively share (e.g., filling out a form)  
- **Observed Data** – collected through interactions (e.g., click behavior, usage stats)  
- **Inferred Data** – derived from analyzing patterns in observed data  

Understanding these distinctions highlighted the **importance of data** in digital communication and how it impacts user experience, personalization, and even privacy.

##  Bandwidth vs Throughput

Lastly, I explored **how data is measured** across a network:

- **Bandwidth** – the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted per second  
- **Throughput** – the actual data successfully transmitted in a given time  

This distinction helped me understand **network performance**, efficiency, and potential bottlenecks.

##  What's Next?

It's been an insightful and motivating first day! I’m excited to continue learning about:

- IP addressing  
- DNS  
- Network protocols  
- Security and firewalls  
- And much more!
