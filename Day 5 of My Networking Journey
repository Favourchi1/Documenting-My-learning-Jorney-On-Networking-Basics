#  Communication Principles & Network Protocols

Today, I explored the **principles of communication** â€“ from human interactions to computer networking.

---

##  Human Communication Protocols

We started by identifying the basic rules that govern human communication:

- **Method of communication**  
- **Preferred language**  
- **Acknowledgement or confirmation requirement**

---

##  Network Protocols

I learned that **network protocols** are rules that define how data is transmitted across a network.

###  Key Characteristics of Network Protocols:
- `Message format`
- `Message size`
- `Timing`
- `Encoding`
- `Encapsulation`
- `Message patterns`

##  Network & Internet Standards

Network standards ensure that all devices on a network follow the same protocols uniformly.

###  Major Standards Organizations:
- `IEEE`
- `IANA`
- `ICANN`
- `IETF`
- `ITU`
- `TIA`

##  Common Network Protocols

Here are some widely used protocols:

- `Ethernet`
- `Internet Protocol (IP)`
- `Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)`
- `Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)`

##  Network Models

### 1. **Protocol Model (e.g. TCP/IP)**

#### TCP/IP Model Layers:
```text
- Application Layer
- Transport Layer
- Internet Layer
- Network Access Layer
