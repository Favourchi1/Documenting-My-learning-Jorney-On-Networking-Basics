#  Day 8 of My Networking Basics Journey: Understanding Internet Protocol (IP)

Today I explored one of the core elements of networking — **Internet Protocol (IP)**. Here's a breakdown of what I learned:

---

##  Devices That Use Network Interface Cards (NICs)

These are examples of end-user devices that connect to a network using NICs:

-  Workstations
-  Servers
-  Network Printers
-  IP Phones

Each device on a network must have a **unique IP address** to communicate effectively.

---

##  What is IPv4?

- **IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long**
- They are divided into **four 8-bit sections** called **octets**
- Example format: `192.168.0.1`

Each IP address has **two parts**:
1. **Network** – identifies the network the device is on
2. **Host** – identifies the specific device on that network

---

##  Subnet Mask

- The **subnet mask** is used to differentiate the **network portion** from the **host portion** of an IP address.
- This allows routing devices to accurately determine where data should be sent within a network.

##  Reflection

Today’s session gave me a deeper understanding of how devices are identified on a network and how they communicate through IP addressing. The idea of subnetting and IP division is key to managing large and small networks alike.

 Excited to keep learning and building my networking and cybersecurity knowledge — one concept at a time!
