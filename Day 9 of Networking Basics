## Day 9: IPv4 and Network Segmentation – Understanding How Data Travels

Today’s focus was on **IPv4 addressing** and how data is transmitted across networks using different communication types.

### Unicast Transmission
- One-to-one communication: A device sends a message directly to another device.
- IPv4 unicast host address range: `1.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255`

### Broadcast Transmission
- One-to-all communication: A device sends a message to all devices on the same network.
- **Broadcast domain** includes all hosts on the same network segment.

### Multicast Transmission
- One-to-selected group communication.
- IPv4 multicast address range: `224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255`

### Special IPv4 Address Blocks
- **Private IP addresses**: Used within internal networks.
- **Loopback addresses**: For testing purposes, e.g., `127.0.0.1`
- **Link-local addresses**: Used for local communication.

---

### IP Address Management
- IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are managed by **IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)**.
- IANA allocates blocks of addresses to **RIRs (Regional Internet Registries)**.

---

### Subnetting
- **Subnetting**: Dividing a large network into smaller broadcast domains.
- Helps reduce:
  -  Misconfigurations
  -  Hardware/Software issues
  -  Malicious intent

Every day, I’m learning how vital structured addressing is to secure and efficient communication on the internet.
