#  Day 13 – MAC and IP Addresses

##  Topics Covered
- MAC vs IP Address
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- Ethernet Broadcast
- IPv6 Neighbor Discovery

##  What I Learned
Today I explored how devices are identified and located on a network.

- Every device has:
  - **MAC Address (Physical/Hardware Address):** Unique to the device, built into the NIC.
  - **IP Address (Logical Address):** Assigned by the network, used for routing across networks.

- When a device wants to communicate but only knows the **IP address**, it uses:
  - **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** to find the **MAC address** on IPv4.
  - **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)** for IPv6.

###  ARP Process
1. Device sends a broadcast asking “Who has this IP?”
2. The device with that IP responds with its MAC address.
3. Communication can now proceed on the Ethernet layer.

- **Ethernet Broadcast** occurs when the MAC address is set to `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`, sending to all devices on the LAN.

##  Key Takeaway
MAC addresses identify devices at the hardware level, while IPs work at the logical level. ARP bridges the gap between them in IPv4, and NDP does the same in IPv6.
