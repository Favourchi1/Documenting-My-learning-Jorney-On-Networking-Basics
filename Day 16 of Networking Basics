###  What I Learned

**What is a Server?**

Think of it like a digital librarian — always ready to serve you what you need.

###  Protocols: The Real MVPs

| Protocol | Full Form | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **DNS** | Domain Name System | Converts domain names (like `linkedin.com`) into IP addresses. Internet’s address book. |
| **SSH** | Secure Shell | Enables secure remote access to devices. |
| **SMTP** | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol | Sends emails. |
| **POP** | Post Office Protocol | Retrieves emails from the server. |
| **IMAP** | Internet Message Access Protocol | Manages emails while keeping them on the server. |
| **DHCP** | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol | Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices. |
| **HTTP** | HyperText Transfer Protocol | The foundation of web browsing. |
| **FTP** | File Transfer Protocol | Transfers files between systems. |

###  Aha Moment

> Every time we send an email, browse a website, or download a file, we’re interacting with **Application Layer protocols** — and we often don’t even realize it.

The Application Layer makes user experience **seamless**, but it’s powered by an incredibly **complex and structured foundation**.
