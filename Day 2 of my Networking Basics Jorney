#  Day 2 of My Networking Basics Journey

Today, I explored some foundational concepts in networking and thought to share a few insights from my study!

##  Host vs. Server

- **Host**: Any device that can send and receive messages over a network. These are the primary participants in network communication.
- **Server**: A specialized type of host with software that provides services like email, web hosting, or file sharing to other devices.

---

##  Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network

In a **P2P network**, devices act both as **clients** and **servers**, sharing resources directly without the need for a centralized server. It’s a decentralized and often simpler network model used in smaller environments.

##  Network Infrastructure Components

Understanding the building blocks of a network:

- **Intermediate Devices**: Routers, switches, wireless access points
- **End Devices**: Laptops, smartphones, printers, tablets
- **Network Media**: 
  - **LAN** (Local Area Network)
  - **WAN** (Wide Area Network)
  - **Wireless Media** (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.)

##  Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

**ISPs** act as the bridge connecting personal or business networks to the global internet. They are a vital part of how we access and interact with the web.

##  Common ISP Connection Methods

Today, I learned about the various ways ISPs provide internet access:

- **Cable**
- **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**
- **Cellular networks (3G, 4G, 5G)**
- **Satellite**
- **Dial-up** (mostly outdated but still used in remote areas)

##  Reflection

This learning has given me a clearer view of how networks operate and the essential roles each component plays. I’m excited to keep building my knowledge in this area as I grow in the **cybersecurity** and **tech** space!
