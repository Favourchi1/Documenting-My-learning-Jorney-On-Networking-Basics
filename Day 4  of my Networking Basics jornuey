# Day 4 of My Networking Basics Journey: Building a Home Network

Today’s lesson focused on how to build a **functional and secure home network**, and I’m excited to share what I learned!

##  Understanding the Components of a Home Network

I explored the essential devices that make up a typical home network, including:

- **Router** – The central hub that connects all other devices to the internet  
- **Desktop computer**  
- **Smart TV**  
- **Printers**  
- **Smartphones and telephones**  
- **Security cameras**  

Each of these devices relies on **either a wired or wireless connection** to communicate and access online services.

##  Router Ports: Ethernet vs. Internet

I studied the physical structure of the router and discovered it typically features:

- **Ethernet Ports**: Used to connect internal devices like PCs or printers via cables  
- **Internet Port (WAN Port)**: Connects the router to the external internet source, usually provided by your ISP  

---

##  Wired Network Technologies

Next, I looked into the types of cables commonly used in wired networks:

- **Category 5e (Cat5e) Cable** – Common for Ethernet connections  
- **Coaxial Cable** – Often used for cable internet  
- **Fiber-Optic Cable** – Offers the fastest speed and reliability using light signals

##  Wireless Networking Standards

I learned about the **Wi-Fi Alliance**, the body responsible for testing and certifying wireless LAN devices across different brands.

I also became familiar with **IEEE 802.11**, the wireless networking standard that governs how devices communicate over Wi-Fi.

##  Wireless Settings

Finally, I explored the various wireless settings found on routers and networked devices, including:

- **SSID** (network name)  
- **Security protocols** (WPA2, WPA3)  
- **Channel settings**  
- **Frequency bands** (2.4 GHz vs. 5 GHz)

Each of these components plays a **critical role** in how we stay connected at home. The deeper I go, the more I appreciate the structure behind everyday tech.

Looking forward to learning more as I continue my journey into **networking and cybersecurity**!
