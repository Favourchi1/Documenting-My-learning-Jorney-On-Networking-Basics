#  Day 3 of My Networking Basics Journey: Exploring Wireless & Mobile Networks

Welcome to Day 3 of my Networking Basics learning journey!  
Today’s focus was on **wireless and mobile communication**, which is at the heart of how we stay connected in our digital world.

##  Understanding Mobile Communication

I began by exploring how our smartphones interact with a variety of systems—not just cellular towers, but also:

- Smartwatches  
- Wireless routers  
- NFC-enabled devices (like contactless payment systems)  
- Wireless cash registers  

It’s fascinating how many invisible connections happen around us every second!

##  How Wireless Networks Work

Here are some key wireless technologies I learned about today:

- **GPS** – For global location tracking  
- **Wi-Fi** – For internet access through wireless routers  
- **Hotspots** – Sharing internet from one device to others  
- **Bluetooth** – For short-range device-to-device communication  
- **NFC (Near Field Communication)** – For fast, secure, close-range data exchange

##  Securing Wi-Fi Connections on Mobile Devices

Security was a major highlight of the day. Here are a few best practices I learned for staying safe on wireless networks:

- Use a **VPN** when accessing sensitive data on public Wi-Fi  
- Always enable strong security settings on home networks  
- Never send passwords or sensitive info in **unencrypted messages**  
- Use **WPA2** or higher encryption for your Wi-Fi connections

##  Manually Connecting to Wi-Fi

I also practiced connecting mobile devices manually to wireless networks. This included:

- Identifying **SSIDs** (network names)  
- Entering secure passwords  
- Reviewing network **security settings** on Android and iOS

##  Final Thoughts

Every day I uncover more about the hidden systems that keep our digital lives running. I’m excited to keep building my knowledge in tech and **cybersecurity**.
