# Day 11 – Dynamic Addressing with DHCP & Static IPv4

## Topic Covered
- Static IP Configuration  
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)  
- DHCP Lease Process  

## What I Learned
Today, I explored how devices are assigned IP addresses within a network, either manually through static IPs or automatically using DHCP.

### Static IP Addressing
Static addressing requires manual configuration of:
- IP Address  
- Subnet Mask  
- Default Gateway  

This method is ideal for devices that require a permanent IP address such as:
- Servers  
- Network Printers  
- Routers  

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
DHCP automates the assignment of IP addresses, making it perfect for dynamic environments with many devices.

### DHCP Lease Process
1. **DHCP Discover** – Client broadcasts a request to find a DHCP server.
2. **DHCP Offer** – Server offers an available IP address to the client.
3. **DHCP Request** – Client accepts the IP address offered.
4. **DHCP Acknowledgment** – Server confirms and assigns the IP.

## Key Takeaway
While static IPs are best for fixed, essential devices, DHCP is a powerful protocol that simplifies network management, reduces configuration errors, and scales well in large environments.
